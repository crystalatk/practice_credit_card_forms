# Practice: User Interface- credit card form

This is a simple practice in front-end using input fields.  

This practice explores:
- different types of inputs
- the different properties of the field
- what the browser expects of different fields
- bulma and bootstrap
- different css properties for styling


Input fields are an easy way to directly interact with the user. Bulma proved to be very flexible adn the documentation is easy to decipher. Browser catches of input field types were also explored and utilized.
