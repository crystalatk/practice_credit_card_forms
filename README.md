# Practice: User Interface- credit card form

This is a simple practice in front-end using input fields.  

This practice allowed me to explore 
- different types of inputs
- the different properties of the field
- what the browser expects of different fields
- bulma and bootstrap
- different css properties for styling


I really enjoy using input fields as a direct way to interact with the user. I also really liked the flexibilty of bulma. The way that bulma's documentation is written is pretty straight forward and easy for me to decipher. I find it very helpful that the browser has catches for user errors in the input fields.
